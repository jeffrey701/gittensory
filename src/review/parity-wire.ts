// Convergence prep (#preconv-parity) — the RECORDING + READINESS harness for the shadow-parity audit.
//
// PURPOSE: before any per-repo cutover from reviewbot to the gittensory-native review, we must PROVE the
// gittensory-native gate decision matches reviewbot's on the SAME PR at the SAME COMMIT. The pure comparison
// LOGIC already lives in src/review/parity.ts (computeGateParity / isParityCutoverReady). This module is the
// other half: it RECORDS the gittensory-native gate decision into the `review_audit` audit-source table
// (migration 0049) so the harness has data to read, and exposes the readiness rollup the endpoint serves.
//
// SHADOW CONTRACT (must hold under every path):
//   • flag-OFF (default) → recordNativeGateDecision is an immediate no-op (NO D1 write) and the parity endpoint
//     404s. The review path is BYTE-IDENTICAL to today: the recorder is the only new statement on the gate
//     path and it returns before touching D1 when off.
//   • flag-ON → SHADOW mode: the recorder writes ONE row per finalized gate decision with
//     source='gittensory-native'. It records ONLY; it NEVER changes what the gate does. The write is
//     best-effort (a failure is swallowed) so telemetry can never break finalization.
//
// WHAT THIS RECORDS vs WHAT IS DEFERRED: this writes the gittensory-native (SHADOW) side only. The actual
// cross-system COMPARISON needs reviewbot's authoritative rows (source='reviewbot') in the SAME table — those
// are written by reviewbot during the deploy-time dual-run shadow step (both systems reviewing the same PRs),
// NOT here. This module + the endpoint read whatever has been recorded; the live shadow run is a deploy-time
// cutover step, out of scope for this PR.

 * The gittensory gate is a CHECK that passes or blocks a merge — it NEVER auto-closes a PR. So the honest,
 * safe mapping is:
 *   • 'success'                        → 'merge' — the gate would ALLOW the merge.
 *   • 'failure' | 'action_required'    → 'hold'  — the gate BLOCKS the merge (holds it for a human); gittensory
 *                                                  does not close, so this is 'hold', not 'close'. This also
 *                                                  keeps the parity SAFETY metric honest: a shadow 'hold' is
 *                                                  never the dangerous "shadow merges where authoritative
 *                                                  wouldn't" direction.
 *   • 'neutral' | 'skipped'            → null    — no decision was made (not gated / pre-empted); not recorded,
 *                                                  so it is never paired.
 *
 * (computeGateParity only pairs 'merge' | 'close' | 'hold'; a null here means the row is simply not written.)
